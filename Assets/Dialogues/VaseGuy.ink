Each of these vases, sir, is naught but the fruit of many a long hour's work. Not mere clay, mind you, but a piece of me, a story poured into form. Each one holds a memory, a bit of life woven into its curves.
People—ah, they fail to see, don't they? They believe these things are but vessels, to be filled and cast aside. But they are more than that. Shehe knew the care I put into each one. She understood. These vases—they are my truth. Yet in this world, truth seems so often to be at odds with the judgments of others.
Without them... it's as though something's been taken from me. A part of my soul feels emptied, as if a great weight has been lifted, yet left behind a hollow in its place. 
Would you, sir, be kind enough to return them to me? In exchange, I offer you something in return that piece of stained glass. It’s yours for the taking. 
    *[Yes]
    So kind of you. I promise to reward you well in return. 
    -> DONE
    *[No]
    No matter, sir.I suppose the world isn't always kind to everyone all the time. 
    -> END
