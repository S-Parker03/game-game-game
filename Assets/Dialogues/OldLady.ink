You’d do well to steer clear of that man, sir. Mark my words—he ruins lives with a stroke of his pen and the weight of his pride.
My Henry, a man of learning and gentleness, was dragged to ruin by his doing. Falsely accused, humiliated before the town! 
I warned them all—my husband could no more harm a soul than the wind could topple a mountain. But that man… oh, he wouldn’t listen.
There’s something on the table that might belong to you. Feel free to take it. 
He never did wrong. Never.
