-> AngelGhost

=== AngelGhost ===
You’ve been here long, haven’t you? Searching, doubting, wondering. But I’ve seen it all. I watched when no one else did. The truth was there, even when it seemed lost.
I saw her cry, felt the shadows speak, and I watched as everything slipped away. The pieces were always here, hidden in plain sight.
It’s not too late, you know. Everything you need is still here. The house holds the answers, if you’ll listen closely. All you must do is see, and the truth will come.
Remember, the pieces are still here... waiting to be put together.
