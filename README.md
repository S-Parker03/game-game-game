Velvet Abyss


You wake up in an derelict house. You don't know who you are, and you don't know why you're here. Explore each room. Look for items that might help you regain your memory and sanity. Find any residents that are hiding about. But be careful, you're in a dangerous environment and you don't know what might be waiting to attack, and any interactions with residents or your surrounding could affect your future and the way your story ends.
